### SHORT DESCRIPTION
The robot uses two NEMA14 stepper motors and the electronics consists of a single Arduino Pro Micro and a MPU-6050 gyro/accelerometer breakout board. Two A4988 stepper drivers are used to drive the motors. The mechanical construction of the entire robot is made up of several 3D printed parts that are screwed together with M3 screws, this makes it fast and easy to assemble.

## MATERIAL

1.    Arduino Pro Micro (clone)
2.    2 pcs. NEMA 14 stepper motors (1.8 degrees per step)
3.    2 pcs. model airplane wheels, the hubs are drilled up from 4 mm to 5mm and press-fitted onto the motor  shafts
4.    2 pcs. A4988 Stepper motor driver modules
5.    MPU-6050 gyro/accelerometer breakout board
6.    3 cell LiPo battery
7.    A buzzer, an LED, and a few resistors. (check the schematic in the downloadable folder)
8.    A few pin headers and sockets, some wire, and some heat shrink tubing
9.    About 20 pcs. M3 16 mm screws with nuts are used to assemble the robot
10.   Two toggle switches used for auxiliary functions
